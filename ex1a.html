<div id= "general">
<p>A cupcake (also British English: fairy cake; Australian English: patty cake or cup cake)
 is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin
  paper or aluminium cup. As with larger cakes, icing and other cake decorations, 
  such as sprinkles, may be applied.<p>

  <div id= "history">
  <p> The first mention of the cupcake can be traced as far back as 1796, when a 
  recipe notation of "a cake to be baked in small cups" was written in American 
  Cookery by Amelia Simmons. The earliest documentation of the term cupcake was 
  in "Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats" in 1828 in Eliza 
  Leslie's Receipts cookbook.
  A Hostess CupCake, showing the typical "snack cake" style of cupcake.
  In the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the name cup cake 
  or cupcake. In previous centuries, before muffin tins were widely available, 
  the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups, ramekins, or molds and 
  took their name from the cups they were baked in. This is the use of the name 
  that has remained, and the name of "cupcake" is now given to any small cake that 
  is about the size of a teacup. While English fairy cakes vary in size more than 
  American cupcakes, they are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with 
  elaborate icing. </p>
