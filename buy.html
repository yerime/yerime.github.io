"Hello," said the doll. "I'm Lola, the Living Doll."<br>
"How nice of you to call," Momo replied politely. "Have you come far ?"<br>
"I belong to you," the doll said. "All the other kids envy you because I'm yours."<br>
"Look," said Momo, "we'll never get anywhere if you go on repeating yourself like this."<br>
"I'd like some nice new things," said the doll, fluttering its eyelashes.</p></div>

           			<p> "You see ?" said the man in gray. "She's actually telling you herself. You can't play with a marvellous doll like this the way you'd play with any old doll, that's obvious. Anyway, it isn't what she's meant for. If you don't want to get bored with her, you have to give her things. Look here !"
He went back to the car and opened the trunk. "In the first place," he said, 'she needs plenty of clothes - like this gorgeous evening gown, for instance."
He pulled out a gown and tossed it to Momo.<br>
"And here's a genuine mink coat, and a tennis dress, and a skiing outfit, and a swimsuit, and a riding habit, and some pyjamas, and a nightie, and another dress, and another, and another, and another. . ."
One by one, he tossed them over till they formed a huge heap on the ground between Momo and the doll.<br>
"There," he said with another thin-lipped smile, "that should keep you happy for a while, shouldn't it ? Or are you going to get bored again after a couple of days ? Very well, you'll just have to have some more nice things for your doll."
And he reached inside the trunk again.</p></div>

           			<p> "Here, for instance, is a real little snakeskin purse with a real little lipstick and powder compact inside. Here's a miniature camera, and a tennis racket, and a doll's TV set that really works. Here's a bracelet, a necklace, some earrings, a doll's gold-plated automatic, some silk stockings, a feather boa, a straw hat, an Easter bonnet, some miniature golf clubs, a little chequebook, perfume, bath salts, body lotion. . ." He broke off and glanced keenly at Momo, who was sitting amid this clutter of toys with a stunned expression on her face.

           			<p> "You see," he said, "it's quite simple. As long as you go on getting more and more things, you'll never grow bored. I know what you're going to say: Sooner or later, Lola will have everything, and then I'll be bored again. Well, there's no fear of that. Here we have the perfect boyfriend for Lola."</p></div>
